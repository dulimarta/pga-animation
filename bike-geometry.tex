\section*{Geometric Path Planning}

Using Mozzi-Chasles' theorem, any rigid body displacement can be produced by a combination of
translation along a line and a rotation about an axis parallel to that line.

Given the initial location and heading at both the starting point and target points,
we want to compute the path comprised by translation and rotation(s) as described by 
the above theorem.
Let $E$ be the intersection of the two heading lines (green and red in the diagrams).
We will analyze several major cases depending on the relative position of $E$
with respect to the two headings.


\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{ccccll}
    \toprule
    Overall Turn  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Relative position of $E$ w.r.t.} & Path           & Comment                            \\
                  & start heading                                       & target heading &                                    \\
    \midrule
    $< 180^\circ$ & in front                                            & behind         & single turn                        \\
    $> 180^\circ$ & behind                                              & in front       & single turn                        \\

    any           & behind                                              & behind         & double turns & diverging headings  \\

\subsection*{Single Turn Paths}
In Figure~\ref{fig:path1turnacute}, the bike starts at point $A$ with its heading shown by
the green arrow and its target is point $C$ with its heading shown by the red arrow,
and both are pointing \textbf{in a general opposite direction}.
The extending headings are shows by the dotted lines intersected at $E$.
Line $EF$ is the angle bisector of the both heading lines, and point $F$ is the
pivot of rotation.

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Path planning with a single acute turn}

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Path planning with a single obtuse turn}
  \label{fig:path1turnobtuse}
\end{figure}


There are two cases to consider:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In Figure~\ref{fig:path1turnacute}a, when $|AE| < |CE|$, the bike first rotates from $A$ and $G$ around the
        pivot $F$  before it continues to translate from $G$ to $C$. The pivot of rotation $F$ is the perpendicular
        intersection from $A$ with the angle bisector.
  \item In Figure~\ref{fig:path1turnacute}b, when $|AE| > |CE|$, the bike first translates from $A$ to $G$ before it
        continues to rotate from $G$ to $C$ around the pivot $F$. The pivot of rotation $F$ is determined
        by the perpendicular intersection from $C$ with the angle bisector.
\end{itemize}

In general, when the turn angle is \textbf{acute}, 
i.e. the intersection point is in front of the start $A$ and behind the target $C$, 
the pivot of rotation is determined by the \textbf{closer}
of the starting/target point to the intersection $E$.
However, when the turn angle is \textbf{obtuse}, i.e. the intersection point is in behind the start $A$ and in front of the target $C$, 
the pivot or rotation is determined by the \textbf{further}
point (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:path1turnobtuse}).

\subsection*{Double Turn Paths}
When the two headings are generally pointing in the same direction, the path can be solved using one translation
and two rotations. The first rotation is an outgoing turn from the start point and the second rotation is
an incoming turn into the target point.
Instead of using one angle bisector, the geometry requires three equal bisectors (as shown by 
the three dashed lines). The second bisector (the center dashed line) defines a placeholder for an intermediate heading 
between the two the turn.

    \includegraphics[height=7cm]{screenshots/double-acute-turn-trans-rot.png}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Double Turns}
  \label{fig:path2turns}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item When start is closer to the intersection $|AE| < |CE|$, the pivot of the
        outgoing turn at $F$ is determined from the perpendicular intersection from $A$
        with the first 3-angle bisector.
  \item When target is closer to the intersection point $|CE| < |AE|$, both
        pivots of rotation ($F$ and $G$, and $|EF| = |EG|$) are determined by the target point.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Shorter Double Turn Paths}
Comparing the two double turns in Figure~\ref{fig:path2turns},  the case when the start point
is ahead of target (the right diagram), can be improved using a shorter path.
The straight line can be eliminated and the entire path is replaced with two consecutive turning arcs: 
an outgoing arc from the start point
followed by an incoming arc into the target point. Furthermore, these two arcs can either be 
left-then-right or right-then-left.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{screenshots/double-turns-right-left.png} & 
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{screenshots/double-arcs-diverging-right-to-left.png}         \\
    Convering R-to-L                                                     & Diverging R-to-L
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Double Turn Using Consecutive Arcs}
  \label{fig:double-RL}
\end{figure}

In the diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:double-RL} assume the following conditions
\begin{itemize}
  \item Point $P$ is the intersection between the two headings. Depending on the relative angle of the two
        headings, they can intersect either behind or in front of the headings. Respectively, we distinguish
        the two cases as \textbf{diverging} and \textbf{converging}.
  \item For the converging case, $P$ is ahead of the target. For the diverging case,
        the intersection $P$ is behind the start point.
        Otherwise, we don't have to use two arcs; the path can be solved using a single turn.
  \item The target point $C$ is to the right of the start heading. Otherwise, the solution requires
        a left turn followed by a right turn
  \item When two headings are converging point $M$ is the intersection of the perpendicular of both headings.
  Otherwise $M$ is the intersection between the perpendicular of the target heading and the start heading
  \item Point $E$ is the intersection of the target heading and the perpendicular of the start heading
  \item Most importantly, $|EA| < |EC|$ this should allow a right turn which originates from $A$ to ``catch up''
        with the target point $C$
\end{itemize}


The two arcs are determined as followed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The outgoing arc/circle must be tangent to $A$, and we can select $E$ as its center
  \item The incoming arc must be tangent to $C$ and also tangent to the outgoing circle,
        Hence its center $H$ must be somewhere on $CM$
\end{itemize}
The center $H(x,y)$ must satisfy the following constraints:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $H = \alpha M + (1-\alpha) C$
  \item $CH \perp CE$
  \item $|HE| = R + |HK| = R + |CH|$
\end{itemize}

Instead of directly solving the quadratic (or higher) equations analytically, we 
apply binary search technique to find $\alpha$ that represents the exact location of $H$ along $CM$.

\subsection*{Sharper Double Arc Turns}

When the target point $C$ is inside the outgoing circle (the largest blue circle in the diagram), the arc on the 
original outgoing circle is not curvy enough to reach the target. To remedy the situation, we move the center $E$
along the line $EM$ until $C$ is outside of the outgoing circle. The search begins by moving $E$ to $E_\text{mod}$, 
the midpoint of $EM$. If the midpoint does not work, the search continues using progressively smaller fractional proportions 
$f$, i.e. $\frac12, \frac13, \frac14, \frac15, \ldots$ with the point interpolation formula $$E_\text{mod} = (1-f)E + fA$$
These progressive proportions guarantee that $E$ is moving closer to $A$, hence sharper turn radii.
